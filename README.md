## Audio Processing in Matlab&reg;
A project for processing and analyzing audio recordings in Matlab&reg; with Audio Toolbox&trade;.
### Part 1
Stereo recordings are loaded into Matlab&reg; and exported as mono.
### Part 2
Three types of lowpass filters: moving average, median, and Gaussian filters, are designed with variable window sizes to reduce noise in audio recordings.
### Part 3
A signal peak detector is implemented for determining the number of syllables spoken in Speech.wav and the beats per minute of a high hat in Drum.wav. For Birds.wav, an algorithm is implemented for detecting and removing regions of the recording below a certain intensity.
